## Abstract

This is a standard interface for non fungible, double signature, multi-token, Soulbound Token standard. It was inspired by the main characteristics of the EIP-1155 token and by the [article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) and [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) published by Vitalik Butherin, in which benefits and potential use-cases of SoulBoundTokens(SBT) were presented.

## Motivation

We found a potential problem, the lack of credibility and faithfulness in online certifications, and imagined a solution, inspired by the everyday more common articles and mentions of Soulbound Tokens. We set to combine the best characteristics of each standardized EIP with the sole objective of elaborating a solid and useful token standard.

### Characteristics
* The NFT will be nontransferable after the initial transfer(SoulBoundToken-SBT).
* Is backwards compatible with EIP-1155.
* Double Signature.
* Multi-Token.
* Semi-Fungible standard.

### Applications
* Academy
* Certifications
* Smart Contract certifications(Code auditories)
* POAP
* And more

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Smart contracts implementing the SBTERC1155DS standard MUST implement all of the functions in the SBTERC1155DS interface.**

**Smart contracts implementing the SBTERC1155DS standard MUST implement the ERC-165 supportsInterface function and and MUST return the constant value true if 0x812b9fae is passed through the interfaceID argument.They also MUST implement the EIP-1155 Interface and MUST return the constant value true if 0xd9b67a26 is passed through the interfaceID argument. Furthermore, they MUST implement the EIP-1155 Metadata interface, and MUST return the constant value true if 0x0e89341c is passed through the interfaceID argument.**

## Rationale

### Soulbound/Account Bound
The token was designed as Soulbound in order to it being nontransferable. This is because the type of problem this standard aims to solve requires this non-transferability.

### SBT as an extension to IERC1155
We believe that Soulbound Token serves as a specialized subset of the existing ERC1155 tokens. The advantage of such design is seamless compatibility of Soulbound Token with existing NFT services. Service providers can treat SBTs like NFTs and do not need to make drastic changes to their existing codebase.
Making the standard compatible with EIP-1155 also allows for SBT binding to Smart Contracts, and this can allow for a whole new world of possibilities.

### Double-Signature
The Double-Signature functionality was implemented to prevent the receival of unwanted tokens. As this standard is aimed to academic certification, this functionality mimics the real world: You have to accept a degree for it to be yours, for example.

### Only transferable by token creator/minter or allowed operators (Reference Implementation)
As the problem this standard aims to solve is academic certification, this characteristic also tends to mimic real world functionality. Only the creator/minter of the token under `id` will be able to transfer the token to new people (Semi-Fungible token). This allows for issuer traceability and connections with a DAO Voting System, for example, in order to only allow emission to voted and trusted addresses. Regardless of this, users have full power over their tokens: They can claim/reject them, and burn them afterwards. Token creators/minters have no control over a token after minting.

### Custom error messages instead of require statements.
After testing the standard, we found out that using custom errors was way more gas efficient than using require()
 statements.
### Metadata.
The EIP1155 Metadata Interface was implemented for more compatibility with EIP-1155.

### Multi token
The multi token functionality was used in order for easier organization, all emitted tokens are stored in the same contract, preventing redundant bytecode from being deployed to the blockchain. It also facilitates transfer to token issuers, given that all issued tokens are stored and can be accessed under the same address.

See [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)

### batchTransfer() function
The token standard supports a batch transfer function to multiple addresses, and this was made to ease the transfer to multiple people, making it more gas-efficient and easier for the users.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal is fully backward compatible with EIP-1155.

## Security Considerations
There are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard.

## Abstract

Sbt
compatible erc1155
double sig
burnable

This is standard interface for non fungible, non transferible, double sig token. Was inspired by the ERC1155 and SBT proposed by Vitalik.

Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

nfts intransferibles dps initial transfer
no sbt approved with 1155
expanded by erc1155
esta sbt 721

porque es necesario

We consider this is necessary because of these characteristcs could have lots of application, like Vitalik said on his [paper](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html). 

There is not any EIP with this characteristcs, although there are some proposal with SBT but not like this one.

### Characteristcs
* The NFT will be intransferible after the initial transfer.
* Is compatible with ERC1155
* Double sig

### Applications
* Certifications
* POAP


The motivation section should describe the "why" of this EIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the Ethereum ecosystem? What use cases does this EIP address?



## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).

## Rationale
porque el diseño

We implement the double sig function to prevent the spam or unwanted tokens. We thought the user has to claimed the token they want or reject it in the other case.

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal is fully backward compatible with ERC1155.

## Test Cases
test.js
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes.  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Reference Implementation
dev
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Security Considerations
All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
